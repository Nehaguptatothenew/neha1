Ques 10:-What does @transactional annotation do?
Answer:-@Transactional annotation is used when you want the certain method/class to be executed in a transaction.

        Let's assume user A wants to transfer 100rs to user B. What happens is:

        We decrease A's account by 100rs
        We add 100rs to B's account
        Let's assume the exception is thrown after succeeding 1) and before executing 2).
        Now we would have some kind of inconsistency because A lost 100rs while B got nothing.
        Transactions means all or nothing.
        If there is an exception thrown somewhere in the method, changes are not persisted in the database,rollback happens.
